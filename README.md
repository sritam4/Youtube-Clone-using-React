This is a clone project of Youtube.com made by Sritam Behera to learn the concepts of React.

Some Key Functionalities:
• Integrated multiple YouTube v3 APIs to enrich the data layer of the app, making it possible to display real data on the platform.

• Built a robust search box that offers search suggestions similar to real YouTube.

• Utilized concepts like Debouncing and Caching to avoid unnecessary API calls, optimizing the app.

• Employed Redux store to manage central app data, easily handling app layout and controlling functionalities.

• Dynamically modified the API to suggest videos based on the currently playing video category.

• Created custom hooks to abstract frequently used logic, such as converting API data into user-readable format, making the code functional and scalable.

• Used Tailwind CSS for quick and easy development and responsiveness.

• Used API Pooling to fetch live chats data and shows in UI. 

• Tech Stack: React, Redux, Tailwind CSS, API Integrations.
